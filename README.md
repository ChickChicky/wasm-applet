# WASM Applet

A small project aiming to transpile Java into WebAssembly.

Most of the code was ported from a Javascript project inspired by Tsoding's [JelloVM](https://github.com/tsoding/JelloVM)<br>
(Currently, it only supports the execution of very basic Java code)

# Quick Start

```shell
npm install
npm start
npm run serve
```
